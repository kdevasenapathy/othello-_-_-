Grace Ding - I worked on the implementation of the random moves
player and coded the fundamental structure of the player.cpp program.
I also improved the initial heuristic such that the program was
capable of beating the ConstantTimePlayer.

Kiruthika Devasenapathy - I implemented the minimax tree and ensured
that it worked both using our improved heuristic and with the 
original minimax program. I also updated some aspects of the
board program to work with our program as desired.

Together - We worked on the same laptop (passed back and forth) for 
the development of the initial heuristic and creation of the simple
heuristic implementation.

Improvement: We improved our initial heuristic to ensure it worked 
to beat ConstantTimePlayer. We also attempted to make the minimax
tree to a depth of 3, but were unable to do it in the required time,
even with the strategies suggested during recitation, so we removed
it from the program.
